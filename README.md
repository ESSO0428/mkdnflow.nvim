## üìù Description

This plugin is designed to replicate the features I use most from [Vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki), implementing them in Lua instead of VimL. It is a set of functions and keybindings (optional, but enabled by default) that make it easy to navigate and manipulate markdown notebooks/journals/wikis in Neovim.

If you have a suggestion or problem with anything, file an [issue](https://github.com/jakewvincent/mkdnflow.nvim/issues); or if you'd like to contribute, work on a fork of this repo and submit a [pull request](https://github.com/jakewvincent/mkdnflow.nvim/pulls).

### ‚ö° Requirements

* Linux or macOS (for full functionality)
* Windows (for partial functionality; see [Caveats/warnings](#-caveats-warnings))
* Neovim >= 0.5.0

### ‚ûñ Differences from [Vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki)

* Vimwiki doesn't use markdown by default; mkdnflow only works for markdown.
* I'm intending mkdnflow to be a little lighter weight/less involved than Vimwiki. Mkdnflow doesn't and won't provide syntax highlighting and won't create new filetypes.

## ‚ú® Features

### Link creation
* Create links (to other markdown documents) from (a) word under cursor or (b) visual selection (mapped to `<CR>` by default)
    * Automatically prefix filenames created in the above manner with the current date: `YYYY-MM-DD_<word>.md`. The prefix can be changed; see [Configuration](#%EF%B8%8F-configuration).
    * üÜï Create anchor links from a visual selection if the selection starts with `#` 
    * üÜï Yank an anchor link out of a heading on the current line (mapped to `ya` by default)

### Jump to links
* Jump to the next/previous link in the file, optionally wrapping to beginning/end of file (mapped to `<Tab>` and `<S-Tab>` by default, respectively)
* üÜï Jump to headings in the current file that match an anchor link. Headings must start with a hash, and the path part of the link must look like the heading with (a) any spaces between the last hash mark and the beginning of the heading text removed, (b) all other spaces converted to a dash, (c) non-alphanumeric characters removed, (d) strings of multiple hashes converted into a single hash, and (e) all upper-case characters converted to lower-case characters. For example:
    * `## Bills to pay` will be jumped to if the path in the anchor link is `#bills-to-pay`
    * `#### Groceries/other things to buy` will be jumped to if the path in the anchor link is `#groceriesother-things-to-buy`

### Act on links
* Follow links relative to the first-opened file or current file (as specified in your config) or, if the path is prefixed with `file:`, the path can be absolute (starting with `/`) or relative to your home directory (starting with `~/`) (mapped to `<CR>` by default)
    * `<CR>`ing on a link to a text file will open it in the current window (i.e. `:e <filename>`)
    * `<CR>`ing on a link to a file prefixed with `file:` (formerly `local:`), e.g. `[My Xournal notes](file:notes.xopp)`, will open that file with whatever the system's associated program is for that filetype (using `xdg-open` on Linux or `open` on macOS)
    * `<CR>`ing on a link to an absolute path or a path in ~/, as long as that path is prefixed with `file:`, will open that file with the system's associated program for that filetype (see above)
    * `<CR>`ing on a link to a web URL will open that link in your default browser
* üÜï Open files or websites associated with citations (using `<CR>`).
    * Specify a path to a [.bib](http://www.bibtex.org/Format/) file in your config (see [Configuration](#%EF%B8%8F-configuration))
    * `<CR>`ing on a citation (e.g. `@Chomsky1957`, with or without square brackets around it) will open a file or website, depending on what fields are provided in the bib file. It opens whichever of these bib fields it finds first, prioritizing the higher items: `file > url > doi > howpublished`
* Create missing directories if a link goes to a file in a directory that doesn't exist
* `<BS>` to go to previous file/buffer opened in the window

### Act on citations
* üÜïIf a default .bib file is specified in your mkdnflow [configuration](#%EF%B8%8F-configuration), `<CR>`ing on a citation key (e.g. `@Chomsky1957`) will try to do one of the following (in the following order, stopping if it succeeds):
    - Open a file specified under that citation key using your OS's default program for that filetype, if one is specified in your bib file
    - Open a URL specified under that citation key in your default browser
    - Open a DOI specified under that citation key in your default browser

### Keybindings
* Enable/disable default keybindings (see [Configuration](#%EF%B8%8F-configuration))
    - üÜï Modify default keybindings individually in table passed to setup function (see [Configuration](#%EF%B8%8F-configuration))

```

</p></details>

### ‚ùó Caveats/warnings

* The plugin won't start *automatically* if the first-opened file is not one of the default or named extensions (see [Configuration](#%EF%B8%8F-configuration)), but you can manually start the plugin with the defined command `:Mkdnflow`.
* On Windows, the plugin should successfully load, but the use of certain functions will result in a message in the command line: `Function unavailable for Windows`. The functionality currently unavailable for Windows includes:
    * Opening local files and URLs outside of Neovim
    * Following links within Neovim while `create_dirs` is enabled. If you are on Windows, you should set `create_dirs` to `false` and make sure that all directories you specify as part of a link already exist.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Currently, the setup function uses the defaults shown below. See the descriptions and non-default options in the comments above each setting. **To use these defaults, simply call the setup function without any argument:** `require('mkdnflow').setup({})`. To change these settings, specify new values for any of them them in the setup function.

```lua
require('mkdnflow').setup({
    -- Type: boolean. Create directories (recursively) if link contains a
    --     missing directory.
    -- 'false' prevents missing directories from being created
    create_dirs = true,             

    -- Type: string. Navigate to links relative to the directory of the first-
    --     opened file.
    -- 'current' navigates links relative to currently open file
    links_relative_to = 'first',    

    -- Type: key-value pair(s). The plugin's features are enabled only when one
    -- of these filetypes is opened; otherwise, the plugin does nothing. NOTE:
    -- extensions are converted to lowercase, so any filetypes that convention-
    -- ally use uppercase characters should be provided here in lowercase.
    filetypes = {md = true, rmd = true, markdown = true},

    -- Type: boolean. When true, the createLinks() function tries to evaluate
    --     the string provided as the value of new_file_prefix.
    -- 'false' results in the value of new_file_prefix being used as a string,
    --     i.e. it is not evaluated, and the prefix will be invariant.
    evaluate_prefix = true,

    -- Type: string. Defines the prefix that should be used to create new links.
    --     This is evaluated at the time createLink() is run, which is to say
    --     that it's run whenever <CR> is pressed (under the default mappings).
    --     This makes for many interesting possibilities.
    new_file_prefix = [[os.date('%Y-%m-%d_')]],

    -- Type: boolean. When true and Mkdnflow is searching for the next/previous
    --     link or heading in the file, it will wrap to the beginning of the
    -- file (if it's reached the end) or wrap to the end of the file (if it's
    -- reached the beginning during a backwards search).
    wrap_to_beginning = false,
    wrap_to_end = false,
    -- Type: string. This is the path where mkdnflow will look for a .bib file
    --     when acting upon markdown citations.
    default_bib_path = '',
    -- Type: boolean. Use mapping table (see '‚ùïCommands and default mappings').
    -- 'false' disables mappings and prevents user from modifying mappings via
    -- the 'mappings' table.
    use_mappings_table = true,        
    -- Type: table. Keys should be the names of commands (see :h Mkdnflow-comma-
    -- nds for a list), and values should be strings indicating the key mapping.
    mappings = {
        MkdnNextLink = '<Tab>',
        MkdnPrevLink = '<S-Tab>',
        MkdnNextHeading = '<leader>]',
        MkdnPrevHeading = '<leader>[',
        MkdnGoBack = '<BS>',
        MkdnFollowPath = '<CR>',
        MkdnYankAnchorLink = 'ya'
    }
})
```

### üëç Recommended vim settings

It is recommended to turn on `autowriteall` in Neovim. This will ensure that changes to buffers are saved when you navigate away from that buffer, e.g. by following a link to another file. See `:h awa`.

```lua
-- If you have an init.lua
vim.o.autowriteall = true
```

```vim
" If you have an init.vim
set autowriteall
```

### ‚ùï Commands and default mappings

These default mappings can be disabled; see [Configuration](#%EF%B8%8F-configuration). Commands with no mappings trigger functions that are called by the functions with mappings, but I've given them a command name so you can use them as independent functions if you'd like to.

| Keymap       | Mode | Command               | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
|--------------| ---- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<Tab>`      | n    | `:MkdnNextLink<CR>`       | Move cursor to the beginning of the next link (if there is a next link)                                                                                      |
| `<S-Tab>`    | n    | `:MkdnPrevLink<CR>`       | Move the cursor to the beginning of the previous link (if there is one)                                                                                      |
| `<leader>]` | n    | `:MkdnNextHeading<CR>`    | Move the cursor to the beginning of the next heading (if there is one)                                                                                      |
| `<leader>[` | n    | `:MkdnPrevHeading<CR>`    | Move the cursor to the beginning of the previous heading (if there is one)                                                                                      |
| `ya`         | n    | `:MkdnYankAnchorLink<CR>` | Yank a formatted anchor link (if cursor is currently on a line with a heading)                                                                                  |
| `<BS>`       | n    | `:MkdnGoBack<CR>`         | Open the last-active buffer in the current window                                                                                                            |
| `<CR>`       | n    | `:MkdnFollowPath<CR>`     | Open the link under the cursor, creating missing directories if desired, or if there is no link under the cursor, make a link from the word under the cursor |
| --           | --   | `:MkdnGetPath<CR>`        | With a link under the cursor, extract (and return) just the path part of it (i.e. the part in parentheses, following the brackets)                           |
| --           | --   | `:MkdnCreateLink<CR>`     | Replace the word under the cursor with a link in which the word under the cursor is the name of the link                                                     |
| --           | --   | `:Mkdnflow<CR>`           | Manually start Mkdnflow                                                                                                                                      |

### Miscellaneous notes on remapping
* The back-end function for `:MkdnGoBack`, `require('mkdnflow).files.goBack()`, returns a boolean indicating the success of `goBack()` (thanks, @pbogut!). This is useful if the user wishes to remap `<BS>` so that when `goBack()` is unsuccessful, another function is performed.

## üîß Recent changes
* 04/05/22: Added ability to create anchor links; jump to matching headings; yank formatted anchor links from headings
* 04/03/22: Added ability to jump to headings if a link is an anchor link
* 03/06/22: Added ability to search .bib files and act on relevant information in bib entries when the cursor is in a citation and `<CR>` is pressed
* 02/03/22: Fixed case issue w/ file extensions ([issue #13](https://github.com/jakewvincent/mkdnflow.nvim/issues/13))

<details>
<summary>Older changes</summary><p>

* 11/10/21: Merged [@pbogut's PR](https://github.com/jakewvincent/mkdnflow.nvim/pull/7), which modifies `require('mkdnflow').files.goBack()` to return a boolean (`true` if `goBack()` succeeds; `false` if `goBack()` isn't possible). For the default mappings, this causes no change in behavior, but users who wish `<BS>` to perform another function in the case that `goBack()` fails can now use `goBack()` in the antecedent of a conditional. @pbogut's mapping, for reference:
```lua
if not require('mkdnflow').files.goBack() then
  vim.cmd('Dirvish %:p')
end
```
* 11/08/21: Add option to wrap to beginning/end of file when jumping to next/previous link. Off by default.
* 11/01/21: Added vimdoc documentation
* 10/30/21: Added capability for manually starting the plugin with `:Mkdnflow`, addressing [issue #5](https://github.com/jakewvincent/mkdnflow.nvim/issues/5)
* 09/23/21: Fixed [issue #3](https://github.com/jakewvincent/mkdnflow.nvim/issues/3)
* 09/23/21: Added compatibility with macOS 
* 09/21/21: Fixed [issue #1](https://github.com/jakewvincent/mkdnflow.nvim/issues/1). Implemented a push-down stack to better handle backwards navigation through previously-opened buffers.
* 09/19/21: Fixed [issue #2](https://github.com/jakewvincent/mkdnflow.nvim/issues/2). Paths with spaces can now be created.
