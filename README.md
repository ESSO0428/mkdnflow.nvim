### üìù Description

This plugin is designed to replicate the features I use most from [Vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki), implementing them in Lua instead of VimL. It is a set of functions and keybindings (optional, but enabled by default) that make it easy to navigate and manipulate personal markdown notebooks/journals/wikis in Neovim.

If you have a suggestion or problem with anything, file an [issue](https://github.com/jakewvincent/mkdnflow.nvim/issues); or if you'd like to contribute, make a fork and submit a [pull request](https://github.com/jakewvincent/mkdnflow.nvim/pulls).

### ‚ö° Requirements

* Linux
* Neovim >= 0.5.0

## üì¶ Installation

### init.lua
#### [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)
```lua
use({'jakewvincent/mkdnflow.nvim',
     config = function()
        require('mkdnflow').setup({
            -- Config goes here; leave blank for defaults
        })
     end
})
```

#### [Paq](https://github.com/savq/paq-nvim)
```lua
require('paq')({
    -- Your other plugins;
    'jakewvincent/mkdnflow.nvim';
    -- Your other plugins;
})

-- Include the setup function somewhere else in your init.lua/vim file, or the
-- plugin won't activate itself:

require('mkdnflow').setup({
    -- Config goes here; leave blank for defaults
})
```

## ‚ú® Features

* Create links from the word under the cursor (mapped to `<CR>` by default)
    * Currently, the filename provided for the path follows this pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_<word>.md`, where `<word>` is the word under the cursor.
* Jump to the next or previous link in the file (mapped to `<Tab>` and `<S-Tab>` by default, respectively)
* Follow links relative to the first-opened file or the current file (mapped to `<CR>` by default)
    * `<CR>`ing on a link to any kind of text file will open it (i.e. `:e <filename>`)
    * `<CR>`ing on a link to a file tagged with `local:`, e.g. `[My Xournal notes](local:notes.xopp)`, will open that file with whatever the system's associated program is for that filetype (using `xdg-open`)
    * `<CR>`ing on a link to a web URL will open that link in your default browser
* Create missing directories if a link goes to a file in a directory that doesn't exist
* `<BS>` to go to last-open file (has limitations; see [to do](#%EF%B8%8F-to-do))
* Enable/disable default keybindings (see [Configuration](#%EF%B8%8F-configuration))

### ‚ùó Caveats/warnings

* The plugin effectively won't start if the first-opened file is not one of the default or named extensions (see [Configuration](#%EF%B8%8F-configuration)).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Currently, the setup function uses the defaults shown below. See the descriptions and non-default options in the comments above each setting. To change these settings, specify new values for them wherever you've placed the setup function.

```lua
require('mkdnflow').setup({
    -- Type: boolean. Use default mappings (see '‚ùïCommands and default mappings').
    -- 'false' disables mappings
    default_mappings = true,        

    -- Type: boolean. Create directories (recursively) if link contains a missing directory.
    -- 'false' prevents missing directories from being created
    create_dirs = true,             

    -- Type: string. Navigate to links relative to the directory of the first-opened file.
    -- 'current' navigates links relative to currently open file
    links_relative_to = 'first',    

    -- Type: key-value pair(s). The plugin's features are enabled only when one
    -- of these filetypes is opened; otherwise, the plugin does nothing.
    filetypes = {md = true, rmd = true, markdown = true}
})
```

### ‚ùï Commands and default mappings

These default mappings can be disabled; see [Configuration](#%EF%B8%8F-configuration).

|---------- | ---- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<Tab>`   | n    | `:MkdnNextLink<CR>`   | Move cursor to the beginning of the next link (if there is a next link)                                                                                      |
| `<S-Tab>` | n    | `:MkdnPrevLink<CR>`   | Move the cursor to the beginning of the previous link (if there is one)                                                                                      |

| `<CR>`    | n    | `:MkdnFollowPath<CR>` | Open the link under the cursor, creating missing directories if desired, or if there is no link under the cursor, make a link from the word under the cursor |
| --        | --   | `:MkdnGetPath<CR>`    | With a link under the cursor, extract (and return) just the path part of it (i.e. the part in parentheses, following the brackets)                           |
| --        | --   | `:MkdnCreateLink<CR>` | Replace the word under the cursor with a link in which the word under the cursor is the name of the link                                                     |
